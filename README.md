- We accessed the GitHub API using a Private Access Token to gather user and repository information, including user location and follower count, using pagination and rate-limiting precautions. Each user's details and repositories were retrieved using token authentication, ensuring we captured accurate and complete data for in-depth analysis of Github users and trends In Shanghai with over 200 followers.

- The most interesting insight revealed that developers who write longer, more descriptive bios tend to have a significantly higher follower count, and permissive open-source licenses, like MIT or Apache, showing that a well-crafted bio can increase visibility and engagement with other users in the GitHub community, beyond simply showcasing technical skills. Python, Javascript, Go, etc. are in demand.

- Based on our analysis, developers looking to increase their followers should focus on creating detailed bios that reflect their work and interests, actively maintain repositories, and highlight project documentation, as these factors collectively contribute to stronger community engagement and potentially more opportunities. It was also recorded that many of the Bio's were in Chinese, this can be looked upon in order to be more accesible to everyone.
